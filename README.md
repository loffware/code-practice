This is a repository of solutions I initially developed for Project Euler exercises as a means of practicing the Go language. After not too many exercises, I realized that Go was the last language I want to do these exercises in.
Now this repository will be full of Python and Haskell and the like, and I'll find something else to practice Go on.
