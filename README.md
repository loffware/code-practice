This is a repository of practice code. I initially developed solutions to Project Euler exercises as a means of practicing the Go language. After not too many exercises, I decided to use better tools for the job and that Go is not the language I want to use for numerical computing.
Now this repository is for a wide variety of programs for fun, and any bigger projects will be located elsewhere.
